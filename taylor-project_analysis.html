<h1>Project Analysis - Taryn Taylor</h1>

<section>
<h2>Site Intent</h2>

<p>The current Spring Lake Elementary website is not user friendly or aesthetically pleasing. The inefficient use of navigation and disorganization of content makes it time consuming and difficult for the average user to find what they need or accomplish what they need to do. Therefore, the intent of the newly redesigned site is to increase efficiency and user friendliness. To do this, the overall design of the site will be overhauled to be more aesthetically pleasing. This will include the actual organization of the layout on the page as well as color schemes and typographical attributes.  Careful attention will be paid to certain aspects of design that make reading the site and locating specific content easier for the user. This will include the navigation, form structure, links and buttons. After the redesign, the user will be able to easily peruse the site as well as complete their specific task that they have set out to do.</p>

When doing a web search for elementary schools in Altamonte Springs, nearby schools will come up in the results. The closest public elementary schools to Spring Lake, and therefore the largest competitors are Forest City Elementary and Lake Orienta Elementary School. Potential parents of school-goers will be researching the different options within the area and will most likely come across these competitors. Lake Orienta has a nicely organized website. Forest City's is not exactly eye-catching, but does a much better job of organization than Spring Lake. 

According to alexa.com, all three of these sites have the same demographics because they are all connected by the same domain name, k12.fl.us. The traffic rank of this domain is 10,954.

<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>


The main target group is the parent (most likely mom) of a child who attends Spring Lake Elementary School. This mom is  probably in her 30s and is accessing the site from her home computer. At the least, she will be visiting the website annually or semiannually to see the school supplies needed as well as the staff and teacher listing for her child's class. Parents who rely on the site on a more regular basis will be looking for access to lunch menus, upcoming meeting and important dates, as well as changes in school policies and phone numbers/contact information.

A smaller target market will be parents who are new to the area or have children coming of age to begin elementary school. This parent will be comparing schools to each other and will want to see the location of the school, contact information, general information and policies. Their concern is less on the day-to-day happenings at the school and more about overall information.

Another small target will be the student themselves. The student will be attending Spring Lake Elementary and will be in the age range of 5-12 years old. The student will be looking at the school calendar, lunch menu and perhaps contact information for their teacher or guidance counselor.
